Title: Creating a GitHub Page with Pelican
Date: 2025-06-25 20:05

The inspiration for using Pelican was heavily drawn from [Simulatine's 100 Days of Code Blog](https://simulatine.github.io/100DaysOfCode/day-4-moving-from-jekyll-to-pelican.html).
I followed the same steps as Simulatine, and found different challenges.

I'm using uv and Python 3.11.

Below are the steps I followed after failing to create a page for the first time.
I will relate the error I commited the first time later on so you don't have to go through the same.

Following the steps in the [Quickstart Guide](https://docs.getpelican.com/en/latest/quickstart.html):

## Steps

1. Create a new directory for the project

```bash
$ mkdir ~/taniomis_repos/taniomis_notebook
$ cd ~/taniomis_repos/taniomis_notebook
```

2. Initialize the project with `uv`

```bash
$ uv init
$ uv add pelican[markdown]
```

3. Quickstart Pelican

```bash
$ uv run pelican-quickstart
Welcome to pelican-quickstart v4.11.0.

This script will help you create a new Pelican-based website.

Please answer the following questions so this script can generate the files
needed by Pelican.


> Where do you want to create your new web site? [.]
> What will be the title of this web site? Taniomi's Notebook
> Who will be the author of this web site? Taniomi
> What will be the default language of this web site? [pt] en
> Do you want to specify a URL prefix? e.g., https://example.com   (Y/n) y
> What is your URL prefix? (see above example; no trailing slash) https://taniomi.github.io/taniomis_notebook
> Do you want to enable article pagination? (Y/n) 
> How many articles per page do you want? [10] 
> What is your time zone? [Europe/Rome] America/Sao_Paulo
> Do you want to generate a tasks.py/Makefile to automate generation and publishing? (Y/n) 
> Do you want to upload your website using FTP? (y/N) 
> Do you want to upload your website using SSH? (y/N) 
> Do you want to upload your website using Dropbox? (y/N) 
> Do you want to upload your website using S3? (y/N) 
> Do you want to upload your website using Rackspace Cloud Files? (y/N) 
> Do you want to upload your website using GitHub Pages? (y/N) y
> Is this your personal page (username.github.io)? (y/N)
Done. Your new project is available at C:\Users\Milena\taniomis_repos\taniomis_notebook
```

At this point, I had a `uv.lock`, a `pyproject.toml`, a `content` folder, a Makefile and some python files (`pelicanconf.py`, `publishconf.py`, `tasks.py`).

4. Generate the site and make sure to run it in the root directory.

The `-o` flag indicates the output directory, and the `-s` flag indicates the settings file.

```bash
$ uv run pelican content -o output -s pelicanconf.py
Done: Processed 0 articles, 0 drafts, 0 hidden articles, 0 pages, 0 hidden pages
and 0 draft pages in 0.13 seconds.
```

Everything ran smoothly and the `output` folder was created with HTML and CSS files.

5. Open a new terminal to preview the site

From the root directory, I opened a new terminal window and launched Pelican's web server to preview the site:

```bash
$ uv run pelican --listen
Serving site at: http://127.0.0.1:8000 - Tap CTRL-C to stop
```

Opening the URL `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` in my browser, I had a simple empty page, but everything was working fine!

## Publishing to GitHub Pages

Now, it was time to publish the site to GitHub Pages.
I followed the instructions in the [Pelican docs](docs.getpelican.com/en/latest/tips.html#publishing-a-project-site-to-github-pages-from-a-branch).

1. Install `ghp-import`:

```bash
$ uv add ghp-import
```

2. Add the `output` directory to the `gh-pages` branch with ghp-import:

```bash
$ uv run ghp-import output -b gh-pages
```

3. Create the repo in GitHub

I created the repo using `gh repo create`.

```bash
$ gh repo create
(...)
âœ“ Added remote git@github.com:taniomi/taniomis_notebook.git
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "chore: initial commit"
```

4. Push the repo to GitHub

Pushing the `gh-pages` branch publishes the site.

```bash
$ git push origin main
$ git push origin gh-pages
```

> Here's the error that I mentioned earlier!
>
> My error was pushing the `gh-pages` branch **before** the `main` branch.
>
> Pushing the `gh-pages` branch first makes it so that the CSS files can't be found.
>
> Push the `main` branch first, then the `gh-pages` branch.

5. See the page

I opened the URL `https://taniomi.github.io/taniomis_notebook/` in my browser and saw the result!

## Difficulties along the way

Just for the record, this is how your site will look like if you push the `gh-pages` branch first.

![my-site-first-deploy]({static}/images/my-site-first-deploy.png)

After some research, I found out that the site URL in `pelicanconf.py` wasn't set up.
That means that the path to the theme files was incorrect.

Checking `index.html`, I found out that it was using a relative path to the theme files.
It should be "https://taniomi.github.io/taniomis_notebook/theme/css/main.css".

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/theme/css/main.css" /></head>
```

But even setting up the site URL in `pelicanconf.py`, deleting the `output` folder and regenerating the site, it still wouldn't work.

I didn't want to dig too deep into troubleshooting, so I simply started a new repo, trying to push the `main` branch first, and that worked.

## Conclusion

It was fun experimenting with Pelican. It is actually very easy to setup, and I just commited a silly mistake.

Pelican is a good tool for creating static websites and being python-based, it feels very familiar.

Another tool I found interesting is [Quarto](https://quarto.org/). You can "author using traditional notebook UIs or with a plain text markdown representation of notebooks"[^1]. Maybe I will try it in the future.
